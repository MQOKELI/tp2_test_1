In Source code management lifecycle for collaborative software development Its where we use version control system which is github.This center simplifies the work when you are working as team because each and every individual is able to communicate with others in one source code without disturbing others in their convinent of their homes. In this lifecycle we follow the steps that include cloning,branch,adding, commiting, and merge, linking github with local machine, push. I will breifly explain what each steps do.
Cloning-where an individual take the resipository online to his or her local machine so that he/she will be able to work on it.
branch-an individual create his or her branch so that he/she can make his/her changes on a source code particularly in his/her local machine
adding-an individual done to make changes in order for others or the manager to track the proccess, so  each individual he/she will be required to add it on staging area.
commiting changes-means since changes are being done by an and added on staging area so he/she will commit the changes.
merge-
linking github with local machine means that since the changes have been done and changes commited now inorder for the repository that is on local machine to be taken back to github and individual need to link it.
push- taking back repository that is on local machine to github.
